# VICE_Stan_example

## TODO

- see if we can authenticate GitHub more automatically
- see if we can open Rproj automatically
- can we speed up the `renv` approach somehow? Currently you can bring in the lockfile but each VICE instance starts with a fresh cache, and it takes some time for that cache to get set up
